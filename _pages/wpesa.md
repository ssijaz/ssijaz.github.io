As a graduate student at UCSD with a regional focus on South Asia, I realized the need for a space where early-career South Asianists could meet, present work
and receive quality feedback. In collaboration with [Sarah Thompson](https://www.sarahthompson.info) and [Aidan Milliff](https://aidanmilliff.com), I founded a 
virtual workshop on South Asia. Titled 'Workshop on the Political Economy of South Asia', [WPESA](https://wpesa.net) has received support from multiple faculty
members and practitioners over its two iterations. I hope that we can continue to have future WPESA meetings and that it institutionalizes into a space that continues
to exist for the forseeable future. 

I will also be sharing my experience of organizing WPESA at a APSA 2021's [Teaching and Learning Conference](https://connect.apsanet.org/apsa2021/tlc-at-apsa/). The
panel is titled 'Organizing and Supporting Junior Scholar Virtual Workshops'.
