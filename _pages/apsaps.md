As a scholar of the political economy of development, I have been committed to disseminating my research to multiple stakeholders. During my fieldwork in
Pakistan, I have remained an Affiliate with Pakistan's [Consortium for Development Policy Research](https://cdpr.org.pk/fellows_affiliates/shahbano-ijaz/).
I have also presented my research at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, and shared insights from an [article] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/21/what-would-persuade-south-asians-get-vaccinated-against-covid-19/)
I wrote for the Monkey Cage in a [podcast](https://www.cerp.org.pk/pages/podcasts) with the Center of Economic Research in Pakistan. 

In 2022, I was selected as an APSA Public Scholar. In future blogposts featured at [Political Science Now](https://politicalsciencenow.com), I will be writing
accessible summaries of and reflections on recent APSR articles.

Podcast (Episode 17) available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy-aQz7RjnU&feature=youtu.be).
