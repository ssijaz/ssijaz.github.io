As a scholar of the political economy of development, I have been committed to disseminating my research to multiple stakeholders. During my fieldwork in
Pakistan, I have remained an Affiliate with Pakistan's [Consortium for Development Policy Research](https://cdpr.org.pk/fellows_affiliates/shahbano-ijaz/).
I have also presented my research at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, and shared insights from an [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/21/what-would-persuade-south-asians-get-vaccinated-against-covid-19/)
I wrote for the Monkey Cage in a [podcast](https://www.cerp.org.pk/pages/podcasts) with the Center of Economic Research in Pakistan. 

I am the [APSA Public Scholar](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-today/article/meet-the-20222023-public-scholars/C67306488995FB92972F34124ABC627E) for the 2022-23. In future blogposts featured at [Political Science Now](https://politicalsciencenow.com), I will be writing
accessible summaries of and reflections on recent APSR articles.

Podcast (Episode 17) available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy-aQz7RjnU&feature=youtu.be).
