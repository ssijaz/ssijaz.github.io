As a scholar of the political economy of development, I have been committed to disseminating my research to multiple stakeholders. During my fieldwork in
Pakistan, I have remained an Affiliate with Pakistan's [Consortium for Development Policy Research](https://cdpr.org.pk/fellows_affiliates/shahbano-ijaz/).
I have also presented my research at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, and shared insights from an [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/21/what-would-persuade-south-asians-get-vaccinated-against-covid-19/)
I wrote for the Monkey Cage in a [podcast](https://www.cerp.org.pk/pages/podcasts) with the Center of Economic Research in Pakistan.
