I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Political Science department at the University of California-San Diego. My research straddles comparative politics and the politics of international development. Specifically, I focus on the political dynamics of foreign aid in developing democracies. I focus on voter preferences and their determinants in countries heavily reliant on foreign aid, and on politicians' incentives to engage in the aid delivery process. Specifically, I develop a theory of access provision to foreign aid funded projects and its consequences for democratic accountability and representation. 

My current research focuses on Pakistan and I have accumulated two years of fieldwork experience in the country. Before joining UCSD, I completed an M.A. in Politics from New York University and an MS.c. in Economics for Development from the University of Oxford. 

In 2017, I was a USIP Junior Peace Fellow at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. Previously, I have consulted with the World Bank, UNICEF and the Adam Smith Institute.
