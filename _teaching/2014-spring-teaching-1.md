I have prolific experience in teaching undergraduates across three institutions. From 2010-2012, I taught \textbf{Development Economics} and \textbf{Public Economics} as an instructor-of-record at the \textbf{Lahore University of Management Sciences}. 

From 2014-2016, I taught undergraduate discussion sections in \textbf{International Relations} at \textbf{New York University}. 

From 2017-2020, I have taught undergraduate discussions sections for \textbf{Political Inquiry}, a political science methods course and \textbf{Comparative Politics} at \textbf{UC San Diego}. I have also worked as a grader/mentor for \textbf{Politics of Development}, \textbf{Politics of Human Rights} and \textbf{Politics of Diversity}. In Summer 2021, I propose to design and teach a course on \textbf{Politics of Developing Countries} and \textbf{Politics of South Asia} at UCSD as an instructor-of-record. 

I am mindful of creating an inclusive and equitable teaching experience for my students. My teaching evaluations and statement for inclusive teaching are available upon request.
